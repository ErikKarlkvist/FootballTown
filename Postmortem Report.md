# Project Description
The project is to create an application for a football cup held in a city. The application will contain information about upcoming matches, scores for played matches, rankings etc and also having the possibility for users to find nearby restaurants and events, and admin functionality to post events, change scores etc. The definition of the project is as follows

> This customer is the marketing manager of	a huge football cup	that will take place during the summer
of 2018. In	the	event, there will most likely be thousands	of	football interested tourist	coming to town.	These tourists will need a software tool to help them with, e.g., finding results, coming games, restaurants, shops, maps, other services, etc. The software tool should also help the tourists to schedule their planned activities. The marketing	manager	would like the tool to be simple to use by the tourist, but the organization also need to be able to publish new events (like results and new upcoming events) into the same
software application. The marketing	manager really likes advertising in	general, but his knowledge	about football is quite
weak, so he	will most likely need some help	from the developer team	to	come up	with brilliant ideas of	football-related things	that would be of interest for this specific	group of tourists.

## Reflections

As a team we worked well together this sprint. Everyone attended all group sessions and thoroughly contributed to group meetings. We worked primarily in the second week of the sprint due to Easter. We adopted most of the agile principles introduced from the literature although our primary focus over this sprint was pair programming and was divided as can be seen in the Work Done table.

### Pair Programming
One of the observations we made from pair programming is it often fostered conversation on how to complete tasks and resulted in more efficient code and less errors to debug as the non-programmer in the pair would often spot mistakes. In theory the practice could be inefficient as it relies on two people doing the same task so double the time, although we noticed it meant faster iteration as less time was spent stuck on problems. The course text states "few companies have applied pair programming to “all” their developments for very long. But many programmers have found some dose of pair programming beneficial" (page 105). Our experience aligns with finding this useful, especially considering The React Native framework is new to many of us, however we can also see how this may be challenging to use all the time. From our own experience we often would not be together or have clashing timetables so this would not be practical. One of the areas of pair programming we found the most valuable was the opportunity to give each other continuous feedback, whether positive or negative. This factor helps each individual member to improve themselves. Resource utilization is also one positive aspect of pair programming as it only requires one computer per two-person team, thus making advances in the project possible if any member should not have their computer available.
At the beginning, it was little hard to apply the practice of agile/pair programming, since we are seven members working on a single product. But we managed it by dividing the project into smaller modules and assigning two to three members to work on each module. Even though this action was very great to practice the principles of agile, it was little hard to manage the team as well as to synchronise the modules.

### Scrum Meetings
Another area of Agile we used a lot was the scrum meetings. Each dev session we worked we would all discuss where we were up to and assess our progress. This was particularly useful as it allowed us to see how the project was evolving, what new modules were being added and provide feedback to the rest of the group. This helped keep the group familiar on the structure of the project and added code at a rate we could have an understanding of what things do even when we didn't write that code ourselves. It also allowed the team to be up to date with everyone's development and whether the project is reaching a bottleneck or the continuous integration is working well. Further, it also allowed us to work together and help one another to fix any errors or unclarities with the project, for example if one of the teams did not know how to solve a given problem or implement something.
In general, in the scrum meeting we tried to answer 3 questions

	1) What did we do yesterday?
	2) What will we do today?
	3) What obstacles do you anticipate?

Once these questions were answered we could proceed with the development. These questions allowed us to make improvements in our project and to increase the motivation of involvement in the project.

### Product Owner/Customer
The project has a customer which knows what different functionalities are the most important for their business case. During the first sprint presentation we noticed some difficulties of managing our customer expectations as the customer would want more features that we believed we could deliver in the given time-frame. To combat this we had to work with the customer and make tradeoffs to move some functionality to the backlog for upcoming sprints. The customer will allow for continuous feedbacks on the product backlog and priorities for the upcoming iterations.  

### Code Ownership and Refactoring
Some of the group members were new to GitHub version control and the React Native framework, thus working with Pair programming helped the team to tackles issues by sharing knowledge among each other. Using Git and version control provided the opportunity for members to work on a task simultaneously and then later show each other their work. Additionally, version control was beneficial as it allowed us to revert to previous versions of the code for debugging and quality control purposes (when required). Also it facilitates concurrent development as each team could work on their own branch and merge these with the other work once the feature was completed, which is one of the main advantages of version control.  

### Continous Integration
To manage continuous integration, travis is used. This allows the running of the application whenever a new change is made to the project and if this change makes the application not run, we are notified via an email. There were some issues setting up travis as the project are dependant on several modules such as cocoapods (dependency manager) and the testing framework. The tests refused to run given that the project was missing these dependencies, forcing us to spend some time configuration the travis file to make it run the application. This was completed and the integration platform is now up and running.

### Communication Channels
Other than the face-to face meetings we conducted during the sprint (for example during pair programming sessions), another communications platform was needed. This platform needed to be both efficient and support richness of communication to allow for project progress outside of the 'physical' meetings. For this task, slack was selected. Slack is useful as it allows to split the communication into several different channels which could all have a different purpose (one for development, one for non-work related banter etc) and also supported integration for various external applications, such as travis. Thus allowing us to get notified in the slack once a build had failed.


To summarise, the agile techniques we focused on this sprint complemented each other well. None of them produced conflicts in methodology and they helped the team to work together efficiently. For the following sprint we will continue to work with agile methodologies and also add new items to the application. As the members are now more familiar with the framework and development environment, the pace will hopefully be higher the next sprint.

Pair programming was good when we learned about React Native but it also limited how much we were able to do. Two or three team members were doing the same thing and each task took longer time than if we would have done it individually. Therefore we should be able to increase the workload of the upcoming sprints when we move away from pair programming to more individual work.

# Reflections
The group worked as a team to carry out the tasks defined in the backlog and tackle the problems that occurred during development. All team members showed up to all meetings with a positive attitude. Each member contributed to the progress of the project relative to their level of programming competence. Once again team-work and pair-programming played a major role in accomplishment of tasks. This sprint the work was more divided than previously, making concurrent progress more easily than before. Further, all the different agile practices used complemented each other and made the structuring and administration of this sprint easier than the ones before. The different practices used in the sprint are described below.

## Backlog Refinement
We spent some time refining the backlog this sprint. Initially we had Epics and some user stories, but to break these down into more manageable chunks we spent some time refining these by discussing the epics trying to break these down as far as possible. Once the epics were broken down planning poker was conducted. The tasks that were to be undertaken during this sprint were the following:

### 1.0 Admin View & Functionalities [EPIC]
The admin views and functionality will contain the necessary views and tools for an admin to add items to the backend, for example games and events.
 * **1.1 Create/Edit Event:**
	As an admin I want the functionality to create and edit events.
 * **1.2 Create/Edit News Article:**
	As an admin I want the functionality to create and edit news articles.
 * **1.3 Create/Edit Game:**
	As an admin I want the functionality to create and edit Games.

### 2.0 Homescreen View [EPIC]
 * **2.1 Display Recent relevant information:**
	As a user I want a simple representation of the relevant recent information for the cup so I can keep up to track quickly.

### 3.0 Feed View [Epic]
The feed view will contain news and events.

 * **3.1 Top Bar Navigation:**
	As a user I want to be able to switch between two feed tabs, one for news and one for events. (Implemented through a set of tabs in the top bar)
 * **3.2 Event Tab:**
	As a user I want a tab to view a list of upcoming events for the football cup.

 * **3.3 News Tab:**
	As a user I want a tab to view a list of recent news related to the football cup.

 * **3.4 Event Page:**
	As a user I want an event page to display the information about a specific event when selected from the events feed.

 * **3.5 News Page:**
	As a user I want a news page to display the information about a news article when selected from the news feed.

### 4.0 Games View [Epic]
Information about games and the current points for the different teams

 * **4.1 Top Bar Navigation:**
	As a user I want to be able to switch between two games tabs, one for news and one for events. (Implemented through a set of tabs in the top bar)

 * **4.2 Games Tab:**
	As a user I want a tab to view a list of upcoming events for the football cup.

 * **4.3 Points Tab:**
	As a user I want a tab to view the current scores in the cup for the different teams.

 * **4.4 Game Page:**
	As a user I want a game page to display the information about a specific game when selected from the games feed.

### 5.0 Mockup
We also decided on creating mockups for the different screens that would be created during the course of the sprint, as to help us with the design and to get a consistant look and feel in the application.

## Planning Poker
Planning poker is one of the Key agile practices we used while we develop our project in this sprint, this was used to approximate how exhaustive the different tasks were. As per standard practices the planning poker consisted of every team member assigning a score to each task based on their understanding of the difficulty of the task. Once every team member had given the task a score, the two team members with the smallest and highest score discussed with the group why they gave the task the score they did to try to reach a consensus.

The total points of the tasks are to be used in the upcoming sprint planning as an estimation of our velocity, thus giving us an approximation of how much we can manage to complete in the next sprint. This was advantageous in planning however took quite a while to conduct. Also, as we have not been working together as a agile team for a long time period we occasionally found it difficult to guage timings accurately.


## Pair Programming
Even though the notion of pair programming was adopted during this sprint, members did not sit with each other to code as much as the previous sprints. This was because the team strived to work more at home in order save time and keep up with the larger work-load. We found Slack particularly useful for keeping in touch. We often used the meetings to go through each other’s issues and problem. This allowed the members with better programming skills helping others with their issues.

## Scrum Board
To be able to keep track of who is doing what in the project, we are using a scrum board with all the tasks to be done, as well as the backlog for future sprints. This scrum board is hosted on Trello. Every time a developer starts a task, they put their name on the card and move it into the "In progress" section of the board. When they are eventually done, they move it into the testing column and later into the "done" column. This proved useful as it reduces the risk of people doing the same tasks when they are unsure of what to do.

## Scrum Meetings
Scrum meetings, one of the backbones of the agile methodology, played a crucial role in keeping members up to date with each other’s progress and the project’s current situation. During these meetings, members give a short summary of what they have been working on and how it went with their tasks. In regard to individual's progress, members gave each other feedback and comments. Furthermore, future ideas and plans were discussed whilst a backlog was prepared and updated for the upcoming sprint. We found the time these meetings took worthwhile.

## Product Owner/Customer
The customer’s level of satisfaction regarding progress and development of the application was higher compared to the previous sprint, when she requested for more features and asked for prioritization of tasks. Additionally, the customer appeared to be happy with the layout of the application and the available set of features.

## Code Ownership and Refactoring
During this sprint, there were less problems with GitHub and version control as almost all the members had gained decent knowledge about the GIT commands and how they can collaborate with GitHub. In the beginning the group used various branches to work on their tasks but that seemed to be tedious and inefficient as each individual branch was not updated with other’s latest work. Thus, a branch was created called “develop” which was dedicated to this sprint and everyone pulled and pushed to it, resulting in faster iteration and overall better productivity. The only trade-off was slightly more conflicts.

## Continuous Integration
Travis was originally the team's first choice for carrying out the testing of application. However implementing Travis in our project and  getting it to work with Firebase, has not been easy. The team is still working on the issue to be able to carry out the testing. Using Travis would utimatly allow us to run the application whenever a new change is made to the project and if this change makes the application not run, we are notified via an email.

## Communication Channels
As in the last sprint, we were using Slack as our primary communication channel. This week we also created a shared folder on Google Drive where we put a document with user stories and epics.

## Incremental Design
During the first two sprint we have been working based on simple white board designs that includes the basic functionalities of our project. But in this sprint we produced a rich design of our project through continuous discussion with the team members and our customer. The designs are now finalized as mock ups and uploaded to our project directory in order to have common understanding among the team members and the customer to avoid major modifications while the project is in its around final stage.

## Work at a sustainable pace
In order to avoid degrading quality and errors we worked at a sustainable pace. This really helded utilize our efforts wisely and learn from every sprint.

# Reflections
During this sprint we continued to work in the same fashion as in the earlier sprints, we also had some idea of our velocity given the completed tasks in the former sprint. However, as this is our final sprint we did not do any planning poker but instead took on finishing all the tasks as we felt that this was manageable. All the promised functionalities of the application seem to be implemented, but good be polished a bit more. Some minor styling may be done after the final sprint to make the application look as good as possible.

## Pair Programming
Like the previous sprint, pair programming was not largely utilised this sprint as each member have an understanding about how the framework works. However, we did spend time working together such that potential errors could be quickly solved which yields somewhat of a similar approach to the pair programming methodology. The main reason pair programming was not used was a lack of time, where we wanted to deliver as much as possible each sprint.

## Scrum Board
The scrum board was utilised in this sprint as well, similarly to the previous one. It gave an understanding of what was in progress and how much was left to do. However, sometimes the scrum board was forgotten and there were occasions were team members worked on the same thing without knowing about it. While the scrum board is good within itself, it requires that each team members actively uses it. Most team members have been good at this, but there have been moments of bad communication within the group. This miscomunication and lack of scrum board usage may be reduced in a real-life setting in which the programmers work in the same enviroment (office) and have access to a physical scrum board, such as a white board with post-it-notes. As this is not feasable in this kind of educational project, a digital scrum board such as trello yields a simular result. However, as previously stated, this requires that the team members actively uses it.

## Scrum Meetings
The scrum meetings consisted of catching up on what everyone was doing and working together as described in the *pair programming* section. The meetings seem very beneficial for the success of the project as members assisted each other with their problems or even gave each other new ideas for making the code better. However, the meetings during this sprint was less formal and did not really reflect a scrum meeting in its ordinary fashion. The meetings were more an oppertunity to discuss the work we were undertaking, help each other with potential problems that had arisen and try to get the look of our individual parts to become consistent.

## Product Owner/Customer
The customer satisfaction after the previous sprint was positive, the customer vented their opinions and wishes for this sprint and we as a development team tried to reach a consensus on what could be delivered within the final timeframe. As the number of sprints was very limited, the wishes of the customer may not have had developed/changed as much as in a real life project which made our approach to the project somewhat linear as the initial planned version of our app largely reflect what is in our final version. In a real life setting, scope creep may be more apparent thus making larger compromises needed.

## Code Ownership and Refactoring
As predicted, there were almost no problems with GitHub and version control. All members seem to be adopted to GitHub and how it works. We did some refactoring, mainly moving the navigators from inside views to their own classes, which made the structure of the files better.

Overall the file structure is rather lacklustre, but due to time limitations it has not been a priority. If this was an actual application that were to be released, then we would probably spend more time cleaning up and be more consistent with the architecture and naming. For example, some files are named using camelCase, and some using underscores. The internal definition of what a component is versus a view has not been clear to all group members, leading to some unnecessary confusing when looking for specific parts in the code. Finally, indentation is also heavily inconsistent, in some places two spaces were used, others 4 and also alignment is often incorrect. The spacing issue is most likely due to the team using different text editors. These problems could largely be combated by defining code- and naming conventions at the beginning of the project and by having code reviews during the development cycles.

## Testing
Testing using Travis has worked well this sprint and we've written test for the database classes, where we tested Login User and CRUD for Events, News, Teams and Games. We added some rendering tests for the main tab views, however found it hard to test more than this since we don't do any heavy computations, we just downloads data from the database and display it.

As we are using Firebase, most of the backend code is given by the library, and is not tested by us. We also couldn't test anything with actual HTTP calls, since firebase doesn't allow it. We therefore had to mock all functions that we use in Firebase, which took a lot of effort and time. All in all, we've learned how to setup a testing environment for react native, as well as creating mock-ups, while developing this app, but not much in terms of actual testing and how to do test driven development.

## Continuous Integration
After each team has worked separately on specific feature based on the catalogue on the scrum board, continuous integration has been done by the team seating together. More than the previous two sprints.

In this sprint continuous integration has been used throughout. As testing was utilized more in this sprint and the product is in its final stage continuous integration were more useful.

This gave an approximation whether the changes made the tests fail or pass.
Working alone, each team member produces many line of code which may have some integration bugs when it is integrated with his/her team members work. Sitting together during integration has helped us minimise the impact of these bugs as they are picked upon immediately and the offending coders should be able to diagnose the cause more easily.


## Communication Channels
Slack was largely utilised as the main platform for communication. This was consistent with communication in previous sprints and we have no new observations regarding its usefulness.

# Postmortem


# Reflections
write something here!
## Pair Programming
Pair programming was largely utalized in the earlier phases of the project and served as a means for the team members to get familiar with the framework as only one of the team members had previous knowledge working in the framework. The idea was to speed up the learning process by combining knowledge the members had collected reading up on the framework.

One of the main advantages of using pair programming is that the code will supposidely yield a more qualitative code than if a single programmer were to write the code as the other "ovelooking" programmer can spot potential errors and technical debt that may find its way into the code. However, this is more plausable once both of the programmers are knowledgable in the framework/language they are working in. As such, given that the majority of the team were unfamiliar with the framework we might as such not have noticed the full set of advantages related to pair programming, but it did help us get familiar with the framework faster.

As the project went forward and members were assigned to their own tasks, pair programming started to look differently. Each person were to write some code until the next sprint and if they had any issues, they discussed it during the next meeting. This allowed a rather quick and effective pair programming session for the group where it made the members to work together when it was necessary.

## Scrum Board
The scrum board proved to be a very valuable asset to our team during the course of the project. The board allowed us to keep track on the current state of the project such as completed tasks, tasks in progress etc, it further allowed for a backlog where new ideas and items delayed to future sprint could reside. As such, the scrum board was one of the central practices used in the project.

The scrum board was realized using trello as we did not have the nessecary resources for a physical scrum board. The online version gave the same functionality as a physical one would. However, there were some drawbacks with the board, such as people forgetting to update the cards. One example of this was when several people would work on the same task as the individual that had initially taken on finishing the task had forgot to update the task to "in progress" on the board. This caused unnessacary duplicate work and potential delays to the project. On the positive side, these duplications of work were often discovered early and did as such not cause too much of a distraction to the project. Having a physical scrum board could potentially fix this issue as a developer could physically "take" the task if it were written on, for example a post-it-note. But overall the board was an extremely important asset to the team.
## Scrum Meeting
In over all the project we found scrum meeting is the most important and useful agile practice. In each meeting, every group member has participated and tried to share their experiences and challenges faced. Moreover, this practice was productive on sharing what experience and challenges has gotten during the project work and to figured out which tasks done, and which does not. It was vital to facilitate the development of the project iterations and track the project progress.

During these meetings, the members not only talked about the problems they were facing but also their achievement and what they have learnt. Members also reviewed each other’s progress and gave feedback, specially when it came to the User interface and designs.
## Product Owner/customer
Meeting the customer on set dates pushed the team members to be accountable for their work and take more responsibility with their tasks. This consequently made the team to work together to accomplish the tasks on the backlog in order to satisfy the customer and get feedback in order to develop the application in regards to customer’s preferences.
## Code ownership and refactoring
During the early sprints the responsibility of setting up the GitHub version control and continuous integration builds tools, such as Travis was under the responsibility of specific group members. This due to most of the group members were new to GitHub version control and the React Native framework. But as we were able to proceed with the higher sprints this responsibility was shared among all group members. This has really helped us to minimize the set-up time for the project environment.

Throughout all sprints, we worked based on the features on the backlog. The backlog was populated with features/modules based on the interest of our customer. The team was able to prioritize and select specific modules for each sprint. The selected module was moved to the todo catalog. Every group member was given a freedom to choose a module to work with from the todo catalog. After choosing a feature/module the group member put his/her name in the module and moved it from the todo catalog to in progress catalog of that sprint. After he/she was done with the module he/she moved it from in progress catalog to testing catalog. When every testing and integration of the module with other modules was gone well, the feature was finally moved to done catalog.

 After the feature was done the team was using collective code ownership. i.e.  anyone within the team was given the right to modify the module as far as he/she could enhance its features/there was no strict “ok” requirement from the module owner to modify it. This had its own positive and negative sides. To start with positive side, every module was not under the sole control of a specific group member means, if any group member thought something was missed and wanted to add it, he /she was able to do it easily with no more restrictions. This might have helped us, if any one of our team member was not able to complete the course. From the negative side, when a group member used to modify a specific module, other modules dependent that module was messed up.

Our experience on the project really complements with the literature where it says “during collective code ownership anyone on the team can improve any part of the system at any time. But    one of the worst risks is a general degradation due to inconsiderate extensions (“creeping featurism”)”.

 Finally, even though the team has tried its best to implement refactoring, such as pulling out common modules to a separate module to avoid duplications here and there, we haven’t followed strict coding standards. To mention some of them, some files are named using camelCase, and some using underscores. Indentation is also heavily inconsistent, in some places two spaces were used, but in others 4 space was used. The spacing issue is most likely due to the team was using different text editors. These problems could have been largely combated by defining code- and naming conventions at the beginning of the project and by having code reviews during the development cycles. This counteracts with the literature where it says “agile methods include the idea that teams should adhere to strict coding standards to help quality”.

## Testing
Considering that there were no complicated computation in the application, testing was mainly usable when the data was being fetched from the database. For this purpose, test cases were written using Travis where we tested login User and CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete functions) for Events, News, Teams and Games as well as rendering tests for the main views of the app.

Additionally, most of the backend code is carried out by the Firebase library where it was not testable. For this reason, functions used in Firebase was mocked to be able to be carry out tests on. Even though this process took extra time and effort, the team learned how to setup a testing environment for react native, as well as creating mock-ups during the development of the application.

## Continuous Integration

## Communication channel
We found slack was the most important communication channel. We had a smooth communication among our group members through slack. Every group member enjoyed sharing their views, questions and notification to other group members via slack.



Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences. The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.

Considering the following:

With regards to the agile practices, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

Which practices had the most impact on the software developed? Think of both positives and negatives.
