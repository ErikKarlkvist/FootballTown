# Project Description
The project is to create an application for a football cup held in a city. The application will contain information about upcoming matches, scores for played matches, rankings etc and also having the possibility for users to find nearby resturants and events, and admin functionality to post events, change scores etc. The definition of the project is as follows 

> This customer is the marketing manager of	a huge football cup	that will take place during the summer	
of 2018. In	the	event, there will most likely be thousands	of	football interested tourist	coming to town.	These tourists will need a software tool to help them with, e.g., finding results, coming games, restaurants, shops, maps, other services, etc. The software tool should also help the tourists to schedule their planned activities. The marketing	manager	would like the tool to be simple to use by the tourist, but the organization also need to be able to publish new events (like results and new upcoming events) into the same
software application. The marketing	manager really likes advertising in	general, but his knowledge	about football is quite
weak, so he	will most likely need some help	from the developer team	to	come up	with brilliant ideas of	football-related things	that would be of interest for this specific	group of tourists.
