# Project Description
The project is to create an application for a football cup held in a city. The application will contain information about upcoming matches, scores for played matches, rankings etc and also having the possibility for users to find nearby resturants and events, and admin functionality to post events, change scores etc. The definition of the project is as follows 

> This customer is the marketing manager of	a huge football cup	that will take place during the summer	
of 2018. In	the	event, there will most likely be thousands	of	football interested tourist	coming to town.	These tourists will need a software tool to help them with, e.g., finding results, coming games, restaurants, shops, maps, other services, etc. The software tool should also help the tourists to schedule their planned activities. The marketing	manager	would like the tool to be simple to use by the tourist, but the organization also need to be able to publish new events (like results and new upcoming events) into the same
software application. The marketing	manager really likes advertising in	general, but his knowledge	about football is quite
weak, so he	will most likely need some help	from the developer team	to	come up	with brilliant ideas of	football-related things	that would be of interest for this specific	group of tourists.

# Sprint 1 Log.  
## 2018-03-22: Initial meeting
* Populating the backglog
* Selecting platform and programming language
* Intial team meeting with customer, coach and the full team

## Commitment
This (short) sprint we have committed to setting up the project and learning a bit about React Native and git for those who had not spent any time with this before.

## Work Done

Feature | Time estimated | Time spent per team member
--------|----------------|--------
Initial setup | *3.5 hours* | All members spent the same amount of time

## Reflections
Initial meeting worked well. We populated the background and set up the enviroment.

# Sprint 2 Log
Per sprint, fill out one sprint log section and its subsections.

## Commitment
List the features/stories that the team committed to finish during the sprint.

## Work Done
Log what was accomplished, and how.
Please report on all activities; for example, in addition to coding, planning and design discussion.

Feature | Time estimated | Time spent per team member
--------|----------------|--------
*Name and ID of each feature* | *X hours* | *Member A: Y hours, Member B: Z hours*

## Reflections
Reflect on how the work worked.
This data will form the basis for your final reflection.
As the postmortem will be a writeup, it's fine to use shorthand notes, bullet list, and similar.
Keep within 1000-1500 words.

Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment.

Reflect on the agile practice practiced:

- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?

    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.

- How did the practices interact?
  Did they complement or counteract each other?

- How efficient were the practices, given the time they took to use?
