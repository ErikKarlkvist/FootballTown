# Project Description
The project is to create an application for a football cup held in a city. The application will contain information about upcoming matches, scores for played matches, rankings etc and also having the possibility for users to find nearby resturants and events, and admin functionality to post events, change scores etc. The definition of the project is as follows 

> This customer is the marketing manager of	a huge football cup	that will take place during the summer	
of 2018. In	the	event, there will most likely be thousands	of	football interested tourist	coming to town.	These tourists will need a software tool to help them with, e.g., finding results, coming games, restaurants, shops, maps, other services, etc. The software tool should also help the tourists to schedule their planned activities. The marketing	manager	would like the tool to be simple to use by the tourist, but the organization also need to be able to publish new events (like results and new upcoming events) into the same
software application. The marketing	manager really likes advertising in	general, but his knowledge	about football is quite
weak, so he	will most likely need some help	from the developer team	to	come up	with brilliant ideas of	football-related things	that would be of interest for this specific	group of tourists.

# Sprint 1 Log.  
## 2018-03-22: Initial meeting
* Populating the backglog
* Selecting platform and programming language
* Intial team meeting with customer, coach and the full team

## Commitment
This (short) sprint we have committed to setting up the project and learning a bit about React Native and git for those who had not spent any time with this before.

## Work Done

Feature | Time estimated | Time spent per team member
--------|----------------|--------
Initial setup | *3.5 hours* | All members spent the same amount of time

## Reflections
Initial meeting worked well. We populated the background and set up the enviroment.

# Sprint 2 Log
## Commitment
During this sprint we committed to doing the following:
* Creating the navigation bar at the bottom of the app
* Add views for each tab (page) in the app
* Creating a games component allowing you to view the games
* Creating a news component allowing you to view summaries of the latest news items
* Creating a structure for colouring and styling application elements
* Creating database structure for games and news items

## Work Done


Feature | Time estimated | Time spent per team member
--------|----------------|--------
*1: Nav bar* | *4 hours* | *Goitom 2.5 hours, Rahwa 2.5 hours*
*2: Start Views* | *1 hour* | *Goitom 0.5 hours, Rahwa 0.5 hours*
*3: Game Component* | *3 hours* | *Tobias 0.5 hours, Pooriya 2.5 hours*
*4: Game Component* | *3.5 hours* | *Tobias 3 hours, Pooriya 0.5 hours*
*5: News Component* | *4 hours* | *Tobias 4 hours, Pooriya 0 hours*
*6: Game Database Structure* | *3 hours* | *Erik 1 hours, Alex 1 hours, Johan 1 hours*
*7: News Database Structure* | *6 hours* | *Erik 2.5 hours, Alex 2.5 hours, Johan 2.5 hours*
*8: Color config file* | *3 hours* | *Erik 1 hours, Alex 1 hours, Johan 1 hours*
*9: Discussion: Task allocation & Prioritisation of backlog* | *7 hours* | *Full team 1 hour*

As a group we decided to allocate quality assurance guardians. Erik is now responsibly for the software architecture. Pooriya and Alexander are resposible for design cohesion. 

## Reflections
As a team we worked well together this sprint. Everyone attended all group sessions and thoroughly contributed to group meetings. We worked primarily in the second week of the sprint due to Easter. The primary focus over this sprint was pair programming and was divided as can be seen in the Work Done table.

One of the observations we made from pair programming is it often fostered conversation on how to complete tasks and resulted in more efficient code and less errors to debug as the non-programmer in the pair would often spot mistakes. 


Reflect on how the work worked.
This data will form the basis for your final reflection.
As the postmortem will be a writeup, it's fine to use shorthand notes, bullet list, and similar.
Keep within 1000-1500 words.

Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment.

Reflect on the agile practice practiced:

- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?

    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.

- How did the practices interact?
  Did they complement or counteract each other?
  
 1. The group had divided the tasks into managble tasks for each sprint where the members worked on the assigned tasks using the pair programming approach. This method allowed the members to help each other to carry out the tasks and mentor each other's work. Pair programming ultimatly helped each smaller team to be able to finalise the sprint tasks. 
 2. Pair programming provided the opportunity to give each other feedback, whether positive or negative. This factor helps each individual member to improve theirselves. 
 3. By using the Scrum approach at every sprint, each member presented their prgoress and what they have been busy with. This allowed the team to be up to date with eveyone's development and whether the project is reaching a bottleneck or the continuous integration is working well. 
 4.Some of the group members were new to GitHub version control and react native framework, thus working with Pair programming helped the team to tackles issues by sharing knowledge among each other. Working in pairs also allowed us to debag errors easier and be able to move to the next tasks. 

- How efficient were the practices, given the time they took to use?
 1. Pair programming seem to be the most efficient and effective practice, as it allowed the teams to work together at university and provide help and feedback to eachother as the project goes forward.
